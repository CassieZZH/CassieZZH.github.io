			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My interest in quantitative finance motivated me to study advanced Python, R Language, SQL, MATLAB, and Excel VBA, and take many quantitative finance courses such as Machine Learning, Quantitative Trade, Data Analysis, and PDE. Moreover, I have enrolled in CQF June 2021 program. Fascinated by financial derivative securities, quantitative finance, and active investments, I desire to become a quantitative analyst at a hedge fund to help institutions boost returns or hedge against investment risks. To achieve my career goal, I strived for being admitted in Columbia University MSOR program with financial engineering concentration to gain in-depth knowledge of complex financial modeling and seek quantitative analyst positions in investment banks to accumulate hands-on experiences.</p>
