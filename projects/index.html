    <h3><em><u>Machine Learning Projects</u></em></h3>
    
    <h4>Default risk</h4>
    <p> 
           
    <h4>Foreign investment risk</h4>
    <p>
            
    <h4>Portfolio performance</h4>
    <p>In this project, I use Python to generate the best-fit regression by selecting the set of predictive variables and comparing the regression summary information, out-of-sample R-square, and change in CEV to predict the excess return of the value-weighted market portfolio. Moreover, I computed the average, standard deviation, percentiles, coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of returns of a dozen portfolios.
      
    <h3><em><u>Algorithmic Trading Projects</u></em></h3>
    
    <h4>Price Discovery with ETF Arbitrage</h4>
    <p>In this project, I created algorithms using Python to maximize my profits with utizing the information given to me when a number of traders hold different information and views on particular securities. Moreover, the algorithms I created also capitalized on arbitrage opportunities between the ETF and its components.
    
    <h4>Bid-ask Spread Catching</h4>
    <p>In this project, I used Python to build a market-making algorithm that generates several stocks' profits by capturing their bid-ask spreads. Meanwhile, I reached the minimum required trading volume to provide liquidity to the market and did not exceed the position limits and the limit of shares per order.    
        
    <h4>VWAP Matching</h4>
    <p>In this project, I filled the order as required by the clients and matched the market VWAP as closely as possible over the dayâ€™s trading. To do so, I estimated the total volume of trade and created algorithms with Python to estimate its distribution throughout the day and automatically trade following the market.
