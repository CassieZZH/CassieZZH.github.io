    <h4>VWAP Matching</h4>
    <p>In this project, my role as an agency trader was to fill the order as required by the clients and match the market VWAP as closely as possible over the dayâ€™s trading. To do so, I need to estimate the total volume of trade and create algorithms with Python to estimate its distribution throughout the day and automatically trade following the market. 
      
    <h4>Bid-ask Spread Catching</h4>
    <p>In this project, my goal is use Python to build a market-making algorithm that generates several stocks' profits by capturing their bid-ask spreads. Meanwhile, I should reach the minimum required trading volume to provide liquidity to the market and not exceed the position limits and the limit of shares per order.
       
    <h4>Price Discovery with ETF Arbitrage</h4>
    <p>In this project, my goal is to create algorithms using Python to maximize my profits with utizing the information given to me when a number of traders hold different information and views on particular securities. Moreover, the algorithms I created should also capitalize on arbitrage opportunities between the ETF and its components.
